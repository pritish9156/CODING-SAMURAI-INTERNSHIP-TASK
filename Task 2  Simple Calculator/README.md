# 🧮 Simple Calculator – Java Console Application

This is a feature-rich **console-based calculator** developed using **core Java**, built as part of my Java Internship with **Coding Samurai**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Clean and user-friendly console interface  
✅ Supports 5 major arithmetic operations:
- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division (with divide-by-zero check)  
- % Modulus

✅ Input prompts with clear formatting  
✅ Loop for continuous calculation  
✅ Smart output formatting:
- Displays `8` instead of `8.0` when result is a whole number

✅ Invalid operator handling  
✅ Exit message with a positive tone  
✅ Clean code using:
- `Scanner` for input  
- `switch-case` for operation logic  
- Conditional formatting  
- Error handling

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Java control flow: `do-while`, `if-else`, `switch-case`
- Arithmetic operators and `%` modulus
- Exception logic (e.g., divide-by-zero)
- Type casting & formatting (int vs double)
- Console UI formatting
- Reusable variable management and structure
